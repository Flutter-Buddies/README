## About Us

Flutter Buddies is a discord community for Flutter developers using **regular online meetups** to help and motivate others with their flutter journey and in return receive help and motivation on yours.

Think of it like a study group on steroids for flutter devs. The core of our community is based on the regular small group meetups and getting to know and help other Flutter devs, no matter your background. We have set weekly timed meetups to get together on discord voice chat and discuss our projects, problems we're facing, suggestions, and more. The channel acts as a way to interact between meetups. *This concept works best if we get to know each other a little, give some commitment to the group, be present, and be willing to give back to the group when you can.* Interactivity is key to your success here! Being a part of the active group will help you find a core group of people to help you and for you to grow with as a Flutter dev. You are welcome, no matter your background or experience. We all want you to be a part of the group.

### Group Channels
Group channels are the heart and soul of the community. This is what brings us closer together as a indie developers. This is where the magic happens and it's fun!

**Remember: This concept works best if you get to know one another, you help one another out, and you keep each other on task. The best way to accomplish this is to go to meetups regularly and to be involved in the conversation.**

* **#join-group** - pick out a group or groups that have a time that works for you and "join" by selecting the right emoji to the bot message. You can join any group meeting without joining here, but using this will give you the ability to get group specific communications. 
* **#group-board** - Not sure which group to join? Want to ask a question about groups? Check here. Check out the other group's chats or join a few meetups before deciding. Up to you.
* **Group # Meetup** - This is where your groups will meet at their designated times.
* **#group-#-text** - This is where you can add links and info while in meetup or any time to stay up to date. 
* We want you to feel comfortable to join or unjoin any number of groups that work for your time. Don't see a time that works? Let us know, we'll make one for you. Meetings are for one hour but can go as long or short as the group desires, come and go as you need, but it's polite to stay till someone's done talking.
* There are designated group leaders, but they don't need to be present for the meetup to occur. Someone should try to keep the meeting from stalling out, bring up topics and ask questions of others. 

The goal for these meetups:
1. Get to know other flutter developers.
2. Talk about our projects and where we are going with them.
